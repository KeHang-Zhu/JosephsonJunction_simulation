# JJunction_simulation
This package of python code is used for simulating Josephson Juctions using Kwant package (with the document here https://kwant-project.org). The first folder test is a few test script directly copied or slightly modified from the document. 

The second folder of JJ consists of several samples of code to simulated Josephson Juction (one piece of normal metal sandwiched by two pieces of Superconductors). The main part of the simulation code is modified from Stuart Thomas' original work (snthomas01@email.wm.edu) and it was written according to Averin, D., & Bardas, A. (1995). ac Josephson effect in a single quantum channel. Physical Review Letters, 75(9), 1831–1834. (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1831) and Setiawan, F., Cole, W. S., Sau, J. D., & Das Sarma, S. (2017). Transport in superconductor-normal metal-superconductor tunneling structures: Spinful p -wave and spin-orbit-coupled topological wires. Physical Review B, 95(17), 1–16.
